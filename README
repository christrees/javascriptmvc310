--Well... I was having an issue with some of the edit update in the old code <failed server updated>
--I was thinking it was broken somehere in the source or I had did something that messed it up
--SO.... I figure I'd just rewrite this from scratch using 3.1.0

--OK lets put in the CRUD models we know we need.
--EDIT spools.js
steal.plugins(	
	'jquery/controller',			// a widget factory
	'jquery/controller/subscribe',          // subscribe to OpenAjax.hub
	'jquery/view/ejs',			// client side templates
	'jquery/controller/view',		// lookup views with the controller's name
	'jquery/model',				// Ajax wrappers
//	'jquery/dom/fixture',			// simulated Ajax requests
	'jquery/dom/form_params')		// form data helper
	.css('spools')                          // loads styles
	.resources()				// 3rd party script's (like jQueryUI), in resources folder
	.models('token')			// loads files in models folder
	.controllers('token')			// loads files in controllers folder
	.views();
--That give us the basic crud... but we want to start fixing our server
--comment out the fixture above
--Now we mod token.js
	findAll: function( params, success, error ){
		$.ajax({
		//	url: '/token',
			url: 'spoolspps/token.php',
			type: 'get',
			dataType: 'json',
			data: params,
			success: this.callback(['wrapMany',success]),
			error: error,
			fixture: "//spools/fixtures/tokens.json.get" //calculates the fixture path from the url and type.
		});
	},
--Grab the server files from our old project and put them in 
C:\Users\ChrisT\workspace\javascriptmvc310\spools\spoolspps
 common.php, game.php, gameboard.ini, games.php, newboard.php, nukecookieandsession.php, token.php, tokens.php
--I'll have to remember details... but if we use the chrome dev tools we can see the message passing... once we get all the path
--and server stuff right we should see a list of the tokens for a board.
http://js.javascriptmvc310/spools/spools.html
--YUP... we've got a list of tokens for a game board.
--Now the only 'edit' we will make to the tokens will be a request to own the token by the viewing player.
--The way I was thinking about the logic is the user clicks on a token to request a change in ownership.
--The server grants the request if the current owner is the game.
--The short of all this on the 'client user' side is we only need 'update' which passes the token data element to the server.
--The server responds with the new data with the new resulting owner.
--Lets get the CRUD going for the game model now.
C:\Users\ChrisT\workspace\javascriptmvc310>js jquery\generate\scaffold Spools.Models.Game

--EDIT models\game.js
			url: 'spoolspps/game.php',
--OK... that works but we've got the same problem... guess it's in my issue??
--WOOPS... it's doing a put to games... forgot mod the url but it was passing the modded value... cool..
--EDIT models\game.js
--Change the url and make the update a post
--OK... I think I found my bug... I am not passing back the same id as the request... so the form really does not update because 
--it was expecting the model update of that id and not getting it...
--EDIT spoolspps\games.php
--Add the id as the key to the game array.  Use that key to pass back the game controller update event.
--EDIT models\game.js
--Need to add the correct AJAX for the create
--One question I have was both games.php and games\2 and games was working.... I must have set the apache to script as would think that would work otherwise
--Not an issue, just need to note it so when I go pushing to a server I don't forget.

DONE
	Select a Sport <drop down Baseball Football>
--OK... need to add a view that is a dropdown select for Type Sport. 
--EDIT spools\views\game\edit.ejs and spools\views\game\edit.ejs
--Add the dropdown input select for gametype
	*Enter name of Away Team (text field)
--Function is there but may need to change the view
	*Enter name of Home Team (text field)

--Function is there but may need to change the view
>>>>GAME PHASE 2 - Join Game
	Connects via URL
	Screen shows a tab titled Join Game 
--Function is there but may need to change add a view tag
--Yea... this I need to add a tag to the game list that changes the view of the tokens <the board view>
--Lets put that in.  Add a view link in the list view of games
--EDIT spools\views\game\show.ejs and add
	<a href='javascript://' class='view'>view</a>
--EDIT spools\controllers\game_controller.js and add the .view click handler
 /**
 *	 Handle's clicking on a game's view link.
 */
 '.view click': function( el ){
        $('.game').removeClass('gameselect');
        var curgame = el.closest('.game').model();
        $.cookie('DoDo', 'Dah');
        document.cookie = "idGameBrd="+ curgame['idGameBrd'] +"; path=/";
        Spools.Models.Token.findAll({}, function(data){
          $('#token').html(Spools.Controllers.Token.prototype.view('grid', {tokens:data, game:curgame} ));
        });
 },
 --OK... basically I was using gameselect to id the current displayed game... but not really using this yet.
 --Pick up the model of the associated game via the click .game tag
 --Set the cookie so the server knows which board to give me.
 --trigger the ajax request for the board and display the board of tokens
 --pass the responce to the gridview along with the current game model data
 --Well.. when I went to test this I ran into issues with the tokens edit... which I think are the issues I solved with
 --games, I just didn't know I had them with tokens until now, so lets go clean up the token edit update stuff.
 --Yea... I only worked with the grid view.  We should never actually edit the token.  humm....
 --For token we only need update and findall... well lets get those working correctly with the model trigger.
 --EDIT models\token.js Fix URL, fix POST <was PUT>
 --Now fix the controller so the New token does not show.. just do the list view for now
 --EDIT controllers\token_controller and change init view to list view
 --OK... now things are looking better... we might as well add a pick token to the list view and get rid of edit and destroy.
 --EDIT view\token\show.js
 --EDIT contorllers\token_controller.js and add pick click event to trigger model update
 --OK... now we need to have the server generate new boards so we can switch to them.
 --CLICKING the view on the associated board should load that board.  But my new board generator is not right.
 --BEFORE I just had a board gen thing... I would like to auto gen a unique board id and then allow gamebanks to attach.
 --OK... I was using cookies to message the server and looks like I had some issues.
 --http://www.quirksmode.org/js/cookies.html
 --OK... I was sorting out some server side stuff... 
 --Basically the whole messaging with the servers via the cookies I need to review.
 --NOTE: It looks like the javascriptmvc is issues multiple file request... which is messing up my controller stuff

=== May want to use this when display in the StartGame state
--OK got that working, but still having some issues...
--Looks like when the models are loading they both request and start 2 different sessions..
--CRAP...
--ALSO... somehow the code is setting the idGameBrd cookie and I don't think it should know that..
--THIS is I think is BUG 7 related... the controllers getting messed up initially.
--Funny thing when I do it manually I get the expected update
--Well hell... just do that in the setup to see if that fixes the issue...
--In the setup of the test when we distroy and reset click the view of the board 0 and wait for board to get it
--HUMM... something is wron with nuke I think... check it out..
--OK... I had messed up cookie clearing I think...
--http://www.phpfreaks.com/forums/index.php?PHPSESSID=66njp4nmc51mqvkhu0k1bl1sd5&topic=223785.15
--ALSO see C:\Users\ChrisT\workspace\javascriptmvc310\spools\docs\CAT_PHP_COOKIES_SETANDCLEAR.txt
--Well that takes care of the boardid issue... but I'm still getting to request with multiple sessions..
--Hummm... maybe I should use nuke http://js.javascriptmvc310/spools/spoolspps/nukecookieandsession.php to start the new session...
--Yea... lets do that because it kink of will simulate a login which we will need to do at some point.
--THAT works... basically I'm using the nuke to get the session crap going right..
--Well test runs fine now but still getting the issue with adding the 3rd 
--AFTER HOURS of testing and poking... I think I need to deal with the gameboard 
--WOW... damb thing was a 'value' vs "value" in the view... 
--WOW... MORE LOTS OF TIME messing with cookies, clearing cookies... messing with the token table
--I FORGOT where the heck we are...
--OH.. attempting to get token testing going
--HOLLY CRAP... I just need to sync this... we will continue in next step.
--RIGHT now all the test run but I commented out what I was doing with the token and user ID checks.

--THEN: need to finish up the state transition stuff
--CRAP... I just spent about 20hrs getting the test code running.
--Forgot to comment about it... but basically I had to 'adjust the views' and also
--Had some cookie issues... just making sure the were set to the correct path and such..
--did a lot of work with the test code... it's in the code and the conclusion was not much
--code but a lot of figuring out what pattern to use.
--NOTE: the generated view code puts in code formating that f'up the HTML
--Basically puts returns and space in so the test code picks that up and fails.
--SO... the view templates are critical to look at how they actually output.
--ALSO... I ran into browser dependancys... chome didn't add spaces, firefox did

--NOTE: I had put the grid and icon view in from the javascriptmvc305 project
--I must have something messed up in the pick event logic because the tokens changed view
--when they were in the path
--CHANGE grid.ejs and icon.ejs to xgrid.ejs and xicon.ejs
--RUN TEST:   http://js.javascriptmvc310/spools/funcunit.html
--Now that worked as expected... but the second run got some errors... lets clean that up.
--Basically I use the nuke to clean things up... well, setup test the default so I should move nuke into setup.
--OTHERWISE the first try could be messed up if I have edited the default...
--MOVE nuke to setup and take out of tests
--OK... got green lights on chrome... firefox has the delete key issue <error when I change because I can't delete text in text input>
--NOW... lets fix up the token test to use pointers to the token dom data
--EDIT: C:\Users\ChrisT\workspace\javascriptmvc310\spools\test\funcunit\game_controller_test.js
--OK got that cleaned up..
--Now we want to drop in the grid view
--take the x off xgrid.ejs and xicon.ejg
--OK... now the default of the token controller is currently pointed to list...
--Humm.... actually we really want the game controler load to trigger the token load...
--Lets comment out the window load on token controller
--SO when we click view on the game we trigger the grid instead of the list..
--TO REVIEW:
--game_controller.js is the main even handler
-->view click events are processed
-->>Sets the board cookie
-->>Sends request for tokens to server
-->>Recieves data back and passes tokens and game data to the token view 'grid'
--token_controller.js
-->grid: Recieves tokens and game data from game_controller and renders the grid view
--NOW we need to fix the test dom pointers in the token test.
--Man... lot of work getting that in... but it's because my table mapings changed.
--That seems to be critical is mapping names and keeping the maps
--For the frameworks we should establish a pattern of reading and applying meta-data <transformation basically>
--For NOW... I want to get this up and let the guys help...
--Lets commit this

You can use Ctrl + F5 for a single use basis, or if you want firefox to always reload the page then type this into the address bar:
about:config
type this into the filter:
browser.cache.check_doc_frequency
change the value to: 1
--Apache CACHE config http://serverfault.com/questions/173038/apache-redirect-and-set-cache-headers

[11:22:30 AM] Chris Trees: OK... some candy and the events are not all quite right...
[11:22:30 AM] Chris Trees: http://javascriptmvc310.xplanb.net/spools/joingame.html
[11:23:59 AM] Chris Trees: Defaults to the JoinGame 'tab'
[11:24:36 AM] Chris Trees: Need to click view of the game you want... THEN click the Spools tab to see the game...
[11:26:23 AM] Chris Trees: lots of crap not working how I want yet <event wise> but I'm attempting to figure out how to pass events between wigets... We have 2 - Game and Token... token is the board... game is the list of boards..
[11:26:35 AM] Chris Trees: http://javascriptmvc310.xplanb.net/spools/spoolspps/nukecookieandsession.php
[11:28:18 AM] Chris Trees: Hitting the nukecookieandsession is basically a logout and you can also nuke the ASCII data files so you can see how it starts from scratch.  I also use that in testing to reset and test things..
[11:29:04 AM] Chris Trees: THE big issue is the tags used for BOTH CSS, EVENTS <framework>, AJAX...
[11:29:56 AM] Chris Trees: bascially almost everything is tied to class and id tags... which is what I"m struggling with to get the right patterns...
[11:31:16 AM] Chris Trees: What I need you guys to help on is to establish a GUI 'positioning and tagging pattern' that is compatable with the frameworks 'event and tagging patterns'
[11:32:25 AM] Chris Trees: <basically comming up with unique generic name pattern stuff so we can code the pattern matchs to the GUI pattern matching...
[11:33:00 AM] Chris Trees: ... take the tabs...
[11:35:47 AM] Chris Trees: the tabs may be contained in the 'whole game' but cannot be contained in any of the views... the tabs then hide and show GUI elements that are contained in the tagged controller...  this is why I want to get to a tool chain that we all like that is compatable with these newer tool-chains...
[11:36:42 AM] Chris Trees: in the end... all the tool chains are doing is shitting out name patterns and the search string controll to accesses them <toilet paper>
[11:38:21 AM] Chris Trees: ... Example... <my current crap pile>
[11:38:47 AM] Chris Trees: We have 2 data models game and token
[11:39:11 AM] Chris Trees: each data model has a controller and views
[11:40:29 AM] Chris Trees: To display a spools game board, we need a game, and a list of tokens.
[11:44:17 AM] Chris Trees: SO... the even chain goes from a game list <Games> select a view <view click> which picks up the spools_model_game_<id> and passed that data to a token controller grid view... the token view triggers a request to the server for the associated board tokens then generates the table with both game and token information.
[11:45:05 AM] Chris Trees: My issue is I can't figure out how the framework wants to pass these events and data around yet...  so it's messed up...
[11:46:18 AM] Chris Trees: IN the mean time... you guys can basically start thinking about...
[11:47:03 AM] Chris Trees: overflows... <how to handel data over flows of various things>
[11:49:25 AM] Chris Trees: UI alignments... Joe... absolutes are not good... I need to 'write the code' on the client side.. absolutes would need to be set relitive at some point... I just don't know...
[11:50:00 AM] Chris Trees: Matching the grid up to the token display is always giving me issues...
[11:50:36 AM] Chris Trees: SHAYNE and JOE.... you guys should talk about this as both of can figure this out faster than I can...
[11:51:41 AM] Chris Trees: WHAT I've notice <web search> is the use of display:block; then position: absolute;
[11:52:15 AM] Chris Trees: and they do right: 0px; bottom: 0px;
[11:53:23 AM] Chris Trees: Another fancy thing is they use js in the css to figure out and set crap based on browser crap...
[11:54:59 AM] Chris Trees: I think the absolute stuff is fine... but HAVE to layer that with some overall crap to get the first 'reletive' stuff... just dont' know what the fuck pattern to use that makes it compatable with all the crap... but figure you guys need to look at that...
[11:55:41 AM] Chris Trees: HOLLY CRAP.... I spewed too much... I'll put this in the README LOG
[11:56:51 AM] Chris Trees: https://github.com/christrees/javascriptmvc310/tree/joemod
